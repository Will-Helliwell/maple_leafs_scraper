## Need page parser in PHP

- data needed
    - Title
    - URL
    - Date
    - Author

I have several pages I want to parse some values out of. It HAS to be in PHP so unfortunately no python requests. I need one script that can do the parse that includes files for different sites. 


I am basically trying to pull stories about a hockey team so I can list the stories and their sources for myself. 

I am looking for length of time you think it will take or total overall cost. I just need Title or article, URL to article, date of article, author of article. 

I do not need the contents of the article BUT if we can only pull articles with a specific term in them that would be great so we could ignore those we don't need.  Some example sites I need are:
